# NESPong
Pong written in 6502 assembly, able to run on an Nintendo Entertainment System

## Compiling
The [nesasm](https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm) compiler was used to compile pong.asm into a ROM (pong.nes). 

## Running
I recommend using the [FCEUXD SP NES emulator](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/256/). It includes a bunch of features to
see whats going on in the registers and graphics nametables and all that jazz.

-NOTE- FCEUXD is Windows only. NEStopia is a viable alternative for Mac. I used
Wine + FCEUXD to develop, but it did result in some stuttering when playing the
game.
